DNA was sheared on a Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode) instrument to a target size of 15-20 kb, followed by QC on a Femto Pulse instrument (Agilent). DNA repair, ligation of SMRTbell adapters, post-ligation clean-up and size selection were performed to create a sequencing library. Primer annealing and polymerase binding were performed on the library using the Revio polymerase kit (PN 102-739-100). Finally, one SMRTcell 25M was sequenced on the PacBio Revio System.	bam	/bge-crayfish-HiFi/m84045_240208_211222_s3.hifi_reads.bam	37d9738932e3a41f65e13f2464170372			National Genomics Infrastructure						genomics_template	0.0.1
