# SciLifeLab Metadata Templates

This repository stores metadata templates in use at SciLifeLab, organized according to data type. The information flow between this repository, the data producing platforms and the data submitter with the end goal of data submission to a public end repository is sketched in the diagram below.

## Specific templates available

| Title | Description | Link |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| SciLifeLab Genomics Technical Metadata Template | This template aims to capture technical metadata for genomics data produced at the Genomics platform, compatible with submission requirements from ENA and ArrayExpress. | [genomics/README.md](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/README.md) | 


## General template structure

A template has a _title_, a _description_ and a _semantic version_ number, as well as well as a list of associated attribute fields.

Within a template each template _attribute field_ needs to have:
- Field name
- Level of requirement/cardinality (mandatory vs optional)
    - `mandatory_for_data_producer`: to be filled in by the data producing facility as far as possible
    - `mandatory_for_data_submitter`: to be filled in by the data submitter, not expected to be known by the data producing facility
- Description
- List of controlled vocabulary terms, if applicable
- Target end repository
- Target end repository (field) name
- Target end repository (field) description


In addition to data type specific fields capturing the technical metadata itself, all templates include additional organizational metadata such as 
- SciLifeLab infrastructure platform and unit
- Unit internal project ID(s)
- Associated order ID
- Experimental Sample IDs (as assigned by the unit, 1 exp sample = 1 data file (pair))
- Associated Sample IDs (as shared by the researcher with the unit)
- Delivery date
- Template name
- Template version



Templates are provided as _.tsv_, _.json_ and _.json schema_. A row entry for an individual sample in a filled out _.tsv_ would then correspond to the following information


| <data_type_specific_field1> |...| <data_type_specific_fieldM> | <data_file_name_R1> |...|<data_file_name_RP>| <orga_meta_field1>|...| <orga_meta_fieldN> |
